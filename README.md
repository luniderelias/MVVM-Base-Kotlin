# MVVM-Base-Kotlin
This project contains an example of MVVM architecture for kotlin-based android apps.
I'm trying to set the best architecture in order to unit test complex UI.
MVVM means Model View ViewModel

## Observations
This is the MVVM implementation, I've also developed [MVPView](https://github.com/luniderelias/MVPView-Base-Kotlin) and [MVPLiveData](https://github.com/luniderelias/MVPLiveData-Base-Kotlin).
This project is a study to understand the better approach in order to unit test UI of Android Apps without using any instrumented test.
The key points of MVVM is that this architecture fits with LiveData, thus contributing to reactive programming and enabling complex UI unit tests.

## Libraries
Mockito,
Koin,
Lifecycle,

## Architecture
MVVM with Repositories and LiveData
