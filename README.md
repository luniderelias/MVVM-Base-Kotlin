# MVVM-Base-Kotlin
This project contains an example of MVVM architecture for kotlin-based android apps.
We are trying to set the best architecture in order to unit test UI.

## Observations
This is the MVVM implementation, I'm also developing MVPView and MVP + LiveData in other repositories.
This project is a study to understand the better approach in order to unit test UI of Android Apps without using any instrumented test.
The key points of MVVM is that this architecture fits with LiveData, thus contributing to reactive programming and enabling UI unit tests.

## Libraries

## Architecture
